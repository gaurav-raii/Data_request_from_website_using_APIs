# Data_request_from_website_using_APIs
* This repository contains the code for using an  XML/JSON webservice API to request data from websites.
* The code attached in this repo is for querying data from a particular website called as Musicbrainz.
* Musicbrainz is an open music encyclopedia which collects music metadata and makes it available to the public
* Musicbrainz has an JSON webservice API through which data can be extracted in a JSON format from the website.
* I have written a python code to use this API to download metadata for music albums.
